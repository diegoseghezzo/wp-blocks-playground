# AI Interaction Guide - Times News Block

### üìç **Where to Configure AI**

#### 1. **WordPress Admin Settings** (Required First!)

2. Navigate to **Settings > Times News Block**
3. Enter your **OpenAI API Key**
4. Click **Save Changes**

**Get an API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

#### 2. **Block Editor Settings** (Where You Use AI)
Once the API key is configured, you can use AI filtering in the block editor:

1. **Add the Times News Block** to your post/page
2. Select the block (click on it)
3. In the **right sidebar**, look for the **"AI Filtering" panel**
4. **Toggle on** "Enable AI-Powered Filtering"
5. Enter your **Filtering Criteria** in the text area
6. The news will automatically update based on your criteria!

---

## ü§ñ **How AI Filtering Works**

### The Flow:

```
1. Block fetches 15 news articles from The Times RSS
   ‚Üì
2. You enable AI and enter criteria (e.g., "technology news")
   ‚Üì
3. Block sends article titles + descriptions to OpenAI
   ‚Üì
4. OpenAI analyzes each article against your criteria
   ‚Üì
5. OpenAI ranks articles by relevance (0-10 score)
   ‚Üì
6. Block displays top-ranked articles
```

### What AI Does:

- **Analyzes** each article's title and description
- **Ranks** articles based on how well they match your criteria
- **Filters** to show only the most relevant articles
- **Sorts** by relevance score (highest first)

## üéØ **Tips for Best Results**

### Writing Good AI Criteria

**‚úÖ Good Criteria:**
- `"technology and innovation"` - Clear, specific topics
- `"economic analysis with data"` - Specific type of content
- `"positive environmental news"` - Sentiment + topic

**‚ùå Poor Criteria:**
- `"good stuff"` - Too vague
- `"everything about anything"` - Not specific enough
- Single words like `"news"` - Use phrases instead

### Optimization Tips

1. **Be Specific**: More specific criteria = better filtering
2. **Use 2-4 Keywords**: Sweet spot for accuracy
3. **Include Context**: "for small business owners" helps AI understand
4. **Test and Iterate**: Try different criteria to find what works best

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting AI Features**

### AI Not Working?

**Check 1: API Key Configured?**
```
Settings ‚Üí Times News Block ‚Üí Check if API key is entered
```

**Check 2: AI Toggle Enabled?**
```
Block sidebar ‚Üí AI Filtering panel ‚Üí Toggle should be ON
```

**Check 3: Criteria Entered?**
```
Filtering Criteria textarea should have text
```

**Check 4: Check Browser Console**
```
F12 ‚Üí Console tab ‚Üí Look for errors
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Takes long to load
- **Solution**: Normal! AI analysis takes 1-3 seconds. Subsequent loads are cached.

**Issue**: Same results with/without AI
- **Solution**: Your criteria might match all articles. Try more specific criteria.
